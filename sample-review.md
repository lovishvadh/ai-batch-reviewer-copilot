I'll use the generated prompt to review the code changes shown in the batch file. Let me analyze the diff for the `CODE_REVIEW_README.md` file.

## Code Review - Batch 1/1

### **Code Quality** ✅
- **Readability**: The added usage section is well-structured and clear
- **Maintainability**: Good use of code blocks and consistent formatting
- **Best Practices**: Follows standard README documentation practices

### **Content Analysis**

**Positive Changes:**
1. **Clear Usage Examples**: The added usage section provides concrete examples for different scenarios
2. **Good Formatting**: Proper use of bash code blocks with syntax highlighting
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covers basic usage, main branch comparison, and custom branch comparison

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Line 30**: The comment `# Compare current branch with develop` is redundant since the command `node code-review-generator.js` already defaults to develop. Consider removing this comment or making it more informative.

2. **Line 33**: Similar redundancy with `# Compare current branch with main` - the command is self-explanatory.

3. **Line 36**: The example `feature/old-branch` might be confusing. Consider using a more realistic example like `feature/user-authentication` or `release/v1.2.0`.

### **Suggested Improvements**

```diff
### Basic Usage
```bash
# Compare current branch with develop (default)
node code-review-generator.js

# Compare current branch with main
node code-review-generator.js main

# Compare current branch with any base branch
node code-review-generator.js feature/user-authentication
```
```

### **Security** ✅
- No security concerns with documentation changes
- No sensitive information exposed

### **Performance** ✅
- Documentation changes have no performance impact

### **Architecture** ✅
- Good separation of usage examples from other sections
- Logical flow from basic to advanced usage

### **Testing** ✅
- Documentation is clear and testable
- Examples can be easily verified

### **Overall Assessment**

**Score: 8.5/10**

This is a solid addition to the documentation. The usage examples are helpful and well-formatted. The main improvements would be to make the comments more informative and use more realistic example branch names.

**Recommendation**: Approve with minor improvements to the comments and example branch names.
